## User Narrative SoundCloud
When I log into SoundCloud, I look for the DJ sets that I have already liked. Then I click on a set, and it plays. I can click on the timeline of the set, and leave a comment for the owner of the set to know what part I really like.

I have a profile page that allows me to post sets that I make. I get a unique link to the set so that I can share it with others. I can see data about how many times each set has been downloaded, listened to, liked â€¦ ect.

I can make some sets private, and some public.

I can see who is following my SoundCloud, and I can follow others. I can also search for new artists to listen to. If they have music that I really like, I can like either their mixes, or their page and get updates when they post a new mix.

You can get statistics for how often your tracks are listened to and who is listening.
